<h2 style="text-align:center;">Society and Law both are interlinked area of study. We cannot imagine a society without law/rules/regulations. The situations should be effectively handled, we need proper laws.
 Law plays very crucial role in social transformation in any country. Looking at various problems in the society, many laws have been enacted to cope up with the variety of situations. 
There are various laws but many are not aware about those. To address this situation we need legal awareness activities in the society. 
</h2 >
<h3 style="text-align:center;" >On the other side there are some marginalised people who cannot afford to hire a lawyer for legal advice or filing a case. Legal Aid service is needed to serve these kind of people.

<p><strong>Constitutional Provisions
</strong><p>
 <p> <ul>
 <li>The Indian Constitution under Article 14 states “Every person is equal before the law and has the right to equal protection of law”. </li>
 <li>Article 22(1) provides for the right of a person to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice. When read together, both the articles aim at delivering fair and equal opportunity of justice to all, without any discrimination, financial or otherwise.
</li>
  <li>Moreover, Article 21, the right to life, also provides for reasonable, fair and just trial.
</li>
  <li>Article 39A explicitly requires the state to promote justice by providing equal opportunities to all. The state shall, in particular, provide free legal aid by means of legislation, scheme or any other way to those who are economically backwards or in any other way suffer a disability.
</li>
   <li>Amalgamating the scope of Article 21 with that of Article 39A, been of the view that no trial shall be reasonable, fair and just if a person has no legal representative, owing to his lack of capability to afford one. The state cannot plead financial or administrative incapability as a reason to not provide free legal aid to the accused.
</li>
    <li>The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: According to Section 303 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the accused in a case is entitled to use the right to be defended by a pleader of his choice. Section 304 states that if such person doesn’t have the sufficient means to engage a pleader, free legal aid shall be provided to him at the expense of the state.
</li>
	 <li>National Legal Services Authorities (NALSA): NALSA is the apex body constituted under the LSA Act by the Central Government. It lays down necessary policies and principles to make legal services available, as provided for under the provisions of the LSA Act. It also has a duty to make most effective and economical schemes for legal services and to grant funds to State Legal Services Authorities and NGOs for implementing legal aid programmes and schemes.

	<li>While legal awareness is the natural starting point for legal empowerment, it has often to be followed by legal assistance in actually accessing rights. This is especially so for marginalized sections whose protracted vulnerability makes access to justice particularly difficult. </li>
		<li>Legal assistance can range from legal advice and counseling, to representation in court through litigation. MARG provides legal assistance through its network of lawyers and community justice workers in various parts of the country. MARG provides free legal assistance to the poor and the marginalized e.g. women, children, persons with disabilities, the poor.
