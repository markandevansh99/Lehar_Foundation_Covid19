   <h1 style="color:#e68a00;text-align:center;"><b>Our Approach</b></h1>
   <p> <ul>
  <p><strong> Amidst COVID-19, We recognise that survivors are not defined by the effects of acid attacks, 
by the actions of their perpetrators.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>We aim to socially include the survivors so that to give them a ray of hope for their future. This includes :- 
</strong></p>
<li>In between lockdown, providing Legal Advice and counselling to them through online platforms
     when there families are the accused in Acid Attack. We give them support how to come out 
     and seek help in this difficult scenario.
</li>
<li>Providing first aid guidelines for those who were victims of acid attack in this lockdown and
     can't go out for immediate medical help.
</li>
<li>Hiring and job opportunities to the survivors in between lockdown, where they are hiring interns
     so that they can work from home and support their families.
     The companies have claimed that they will hire the acid attack survivors after global lockdown
     and provide them trainings for their jobs.
</li>
<li> Giving educational tutorials coupons like Computer Science and English for their preparation of upcoming jobs.
</li>
<li>In between this COVID-19, they are helpless and lack resources to learn anything new. We are providing them
     resources to develop their personality and skills.
</li>
<li>Survivors are socially neglected. It is important to aware the general public regarding their Ventures,
    NGOs and businesses.

</li>
</ul>

   <h1 style="color:#77b300;text-align:center";><b>Immediate First Aid (At Home) Guidelines</b></h1>
   <p> <ul>
  <li>


The most important thing is to douse the victim in running water, rather than use a wet cloth as water dilutes the acid.

</li>
<li>If you witness an attack, keep your own safety in mind so that you don't become secondary victims.
</li>
<li>If you see someone exposed to acid don't brush it off with your hands, or if the substance is in powder form just brush it off using a piece of clothing</li>
<li>Take off any clothes/jewellery that have made contact with the acid
</li>
<li>As tempting as it is to add cream to give some relief, this could affect the treatment prescribed by doctors.
</li>
<li>After the acid is washed off, applying an alkali solution would be useful to neutralize the acid. (Baking soda and water) and loosely wrap the burn area in sterilised gauze, to prevent contamination.
</li>
<li>After hospital treatment, patients are advised to stick to a strict aftercare regime as advised.
</li>
</ul>

   <h1 style="color:#77b300"><b> So, What's the ROOT CAUSE?</b></h1>
   <p> According to the Acid Survivors Foundation India, the motives behind acid attacks range from something as simple as a girl rejecting a boy’s gestures of affection, to more deep-seated cultural issues such as dowry. While vengeance is a key reason, there are several other causes, as shown below.

</p>

   <br>
    <div style="text-align: left;">
   <h1 style="color:#77b300;text-align:center;"><b>IT’S TIME TO
ENABLE CHANGE</b></h1>
   <p style="text-align:center;"> Acid attacks have lifelong repercussions that are very difficult to ignore. That’s why humanitarians across the country feel compelled to act, and this has led to the birth of numerous institutions and programmes that help these women take control of their lives again.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;background-color:orange;">Even so, the question begs asking – is this enough?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">In the current scenario, the focus is on helping women after an attack. However, the issue needs a more holistic approach: one that directs its efforts at changing mindsets, demanding more stringent laws, and rehabilitating survivors effectively.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">It is this need that has led to the birth of LEHAR. We aim to bring people together, channel their energies, and build a safer world for women.</p>
